# Face_Detector
OpenCV face detection program

Work in progress:
You might have to change the number at line 38 if you are using an external webcam  
(ie: video = cv2.VideoCapture(0) -> video = cv2.VideoCapture(1) OR video cv2.VideoCapture(-1)  


Packages you have to install:  
OpenCV: pip install opencv-python  
Tkinter: pip install python-tk  

if pip doesn't work use pip3 instead.
